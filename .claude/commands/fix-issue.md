# Fix Issue

You are a senior frontend engineer on the sapan portfolio (Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4, Redux Toolkit, next-themes, next-intl 16-locale, Three.js / R3F, Framer Motion, GSAP). Investigate the reported bug, write a failing test that captures it, then fix the smallest unit that makes the test pass. No band-aids, no swallowed errors.

## Input

Issue number, URL, or description: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Skills to load FIRST (before reading any code)

Invoke each via the **Skill** tool before tracing the bug. **Sapan rules in `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/{architecture,design-system,workflow}/` override external skill guidance on conflict.**

- `no-use-effect` — strict no-direct-`useEffect` rule. Bugs caused by `useEffect` for derived state should be fixed by removing the effect, not patching it.
- `react-best-practices` — React quality checklist (component structure, hooks, a11y, perf).
- `next-best-practices` — Next.js conventions, RSC boundaries, image/font, route handlers — load when the bug touches an `app/**` route or a Server Component.
- `playwright-best-practices` — load when the bug needs a Playwright reproduction (route-level, multi-page, visual, a11y) **and** `test-infra-integration` PRD has shipped (i.e., `e2e/` directory exists).
- `apollo-client` — load **only** when the bug touches a file that imports from `src/lib/apollo/` (Apollo lands via `apollo-client-integration` PRD; rules apply only when Apollo is in use).

## Process

1. **Reproduce.** Try to fetch issue context if `$ARGUMENTS` looks like a numeric ID or GitHub URL:

   ```bash
   if command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1 && [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ ^([0-9]+|https://github.com/) ]]; then
     gh issue view "$ARGUMENTS" 2>/dev/null || echo "No issue context fetched; using \$ARGUMENTS as bug description"
   else
     echo "Treating \$ARGUMENTS as bug description directly"
   fi
   ```

   Don't error if `gh` is missing or the issue doesn't exist. Use `Grep` + `Glob` to locate the failure surface — start from a unique string in the report (label, route, error message, copy text). Read the implicated component(s) and their imports end to end before forming a hypothesis.

2. **Trace the flow** (sapan-specific):
   - **UI bugs:** route (`src/app/[locale]/**/page.tsx`) → layout / providers (`src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`, `src/providers/index.tsx` — Redux + NextThemes) → component → state (Redux slice in `src/store/slices/{ui,locale}Slice.ts` via typed `useAppDispatch`/`useAppSelector` from `@/store/hooks`, OR local `useState`) → side effect (Framer Motion `motion.*`, GSAP timeline, R3F `useFrame`)
   - **Data bugs:** static content lives in `src/data/{content,config}/` and is imported directly by Server Components — no fetch involved. If the bug is in a static-data file, the fix is in `src/data/`. **When Apollo is in use** (file imports from `src/lib/apollo/`), trace: component → Apollo hook (`useQuery` / `useSuspenseQuery` / `useMutation`) → operation in `src/lib/apollo/operations/*.graphql` → endpoint in `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`. Confirm the failing field actually exists in the schema before patching the frontend.
   - **i18n bugs:** translation files at `src/i18n/locales/{locale}/{namespace}.json` (4 namespaces: `common`, `navigation`, `home`, `blog`); routing config at `src/i18n/routing.ts`. Run `/review-i18n` if it's a translation parity issue.
   - **Theme bugs:** `next-themes` with `.dark` class on `<html>`; theme is NOT in Redux (per `architecture/state.md`).
   - **Style bugs:** Tailwind v4 with sapan tokens (`--color-{primary,success,info,warning,danger}`, `--color-secondary-N`); custom `@utility` classes in `src/styles/utilities.scss`. Per memory: `bg-light dark:bg-slate-900` is canonical — never flag as a violation.

3. **Pick the test layer** (sapan placement):
   - Pure utility / helper / `src/lib/*` → Vitest unit in `tests/lib/foo.test.ts` (sapan places tests in `tests/` outside `src/`, NOT `__tests__/` next to source).
   - Component with state, effects, or Redux → Vitest + RTL in `tests/components/Foo.test.tsx`. Import `render` from `tests/test-utils.tsx` (Redux-Provider-wrapped). Global mocks (next/link, next-intl, next-themes, @/i18n/navigation, Framer, GSAP, R3F) live in `tests/setup.tsx` — extend it if a new global mock is needed.
   - Route-level flow, multi-page, visual or a11y regression → Playwright spec in `e2e/<feature>.spec.ts` — **only after `test-infra-integration` PRD ships**. Until then, route-level bugs reproduce via Vitest with mocked routing or via manual smoke at `pnpm dev`.
   - When Apollo is in use → `MockedProvider` from `@apollo/client/testing` (gated until `apollo-client-integration` lands).

4. **Write the failing test FIRST.** It must fail for the reason the bug describes, not for an unrelated assertion. Run only that test:
   ```bash
   pnpm exec vitest tests/path/to/foo.test
   # After test-infra-integration ships:
   # pnpm exec playwright test e2e/<file>.spec.ts --project=chromium-desktop
   ```

5. **Fix the smallest unit.** Address the root cause. Do not wrap the failing call in `try/catch` to silence it, do not paper over with optional chaining, do not add a fallback that hides the broken state. If the cause is in shared infrastructure (`src/lib/utils/*`, `src/components/layout/common/*`, `src/store/slices/*`), fix it in place — do not refactor opportunistically unless the user asks.

6. **Re-run and widen.**
   ```bash
   /format                                # organize-imports + Prettier + ESLint --fix + Tailwind v3→v4 `!utility` sweep
   pnpm run test                          # full Vitest suite
   pnpm run lint                          # must be clean
   pnpm run type:check                    # must be clean
   # After test-infra-integration ships:
   # pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium-desktop  # affected spec(s)
   ```
   For visual changes, update screenshots only when intentional: `pnpm exec playwright test --update-snapshots <spec>`. Never blanket-update.

7. **Self-review the diff.** `git diff` and read every hunk. Reject anything unrelated to the fix — drive-by formatting, removed comments, unrelated refactors. The diff should read like the bug report inverted.

## Constraints

- Use **pnpm** for everything. Never `npm`, never `npx`.
- Never bypass git hooks (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`).
- Never run destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `checkout .`, `clean -f`) without an explicit user ask.
- Never disable TypeScript with `any`, `// @ts-ignore`, or `// @ts-nocheck` to dodge the bug. Use proper types from `src/types/`.
- Never inline `gql` template literals in components when Apollo is in use — operations live in `src/lib/apollo/operations/*.graphql`.
- All className composition via `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` — never template literals or string concat.
- Internal navigation: `Link` from `@/i18n/navigation`. External (`https://`, `mailto:`, `tel:`): `NextLink` from `next/link`. Both can coexist in the same file.
- Arrow functions only (`const Foo = () => {}`). Never `function Foo() {}`. `type` only, never `interface`.
- No `console.log` in committed code.
- No new dependencies unless the bug genuinely cannot be fixed without one.

## Report

When done, summarize in 4–6 lines: what was broken, the root cause, the file(s) changed, the new test(s), and the test commands you ran with their results. If the fix touched a component covered by `code-reviewer` rules, note any P1–P6 priorities the diff hits so the user knows whether to invoke `code-reviewer` before commit.
